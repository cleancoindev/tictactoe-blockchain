This is an experiment: Who will win:

* DogeCoin V2

or

* meta DogeCoin V2

DogeCoin V2 is a blockchain which is mined by posting arbitrary winning games for
a given TikTok position.

The amount of DogeCoin V2 is the discrete logarithm of the quantity of solved games.

Money transfer is accordingly the discrete logarithm (with lost precision).

The experiment is: On exchanges the value of the our currency will be proportional
to the logarithm or to the amount of solved games? (Will somebody create a meta
blockchain that allows transfer of direct amount without logarithm, so messing the
logarithmic finanicial system?)
